# Sano Genetics Frontend Engineer task

⚠️ Please, **do not fork this repository**.

The goal of this task is to introduce you to some of the technologies that we use at Sano, and to give you an experience about what it would be like to have the responsibilities of the role. 

In this test, you will display a list of studies and be able to leave/join any study. The list of studies should look beautiful, be accessible and mobile friendly.

# Technologies:
This project includes the following FE technologies which are the most common ones we use at Sano:
- <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html" target="_blank">Vue.JS</a> (Vue2 + Vue3)
- <a href="https://vuex-orm.org/" target="_blank">Vuex ORM</a>
- <a href="https://vuex-orm.github.io/plugin-axios/" target="_blank">Axios Vuex ORM</a>
- <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank">Cypress</a> (E2E testing)
- <a href="https://windicss.org/" target="_blank">WindiCSS</a>/<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a> + Sass for styling

Please try to complete this test using Vue.JS, SCSS, WindiCSS and Cypress.

If you have spare time, bonus points will be given for using vuex-orm and vuex-orm-axios, but these are not essential.

# Time to complete
